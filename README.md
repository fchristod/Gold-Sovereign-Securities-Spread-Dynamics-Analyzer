# Gold-Sovereign-Securities-Spread-Dynamics-Analyzer | A data analysis project combining SQL, Python and Data Visualization. Deep dive into the details of gold's price and economy behaviour.


I have been provided with a dataset named BoG_Bulletin_Gold_2023-11.csv, which encompasses a detailed record of gold and sovereign gold coin prices over time, published by the Bank of Greece. This dataset is pivotal for examining the financial trends, investment opportunities, and market behaviors in the precious metals domain.

The mission is to harness SQL for preliminary data selection and aggregation, and then apply Python for in-depth analysis and data visualization.

As you can see the project has some csv files, a SQL file and a jupyter notebook, apart from some images for the visualization. The goal was to combine all these data analysis tools in order to analyze the gold market.

The aim of the SQL query task is to meticulously analyze the dataset to detect any substantial deviations in the spread between asking and bidding prices for gold and sovereign securities. By focusing on above-average spreads, we aim to single out and prioritize dates and periods that exhibit significant market movement or volatility. This can be instrumental for traders, investors, and market analysts to make informed decisions.

Time Series Analysis of Gold Prices: The aim of this task is to render a lucid and interactive visual narrative of the price trajectory of gold, focusing particularly on monthly trends. Through this approach, we seek to smooth out short-term noise and bring to the fore the more significant patterns that could be of interest to stakeholders such as economists, market strategists, and financial investors. The use of interactive plotting tools serves not just to engage but to empower users with the means to conduct an in-depth and personalized exploration of the data. ðŸ”¬ðŸ“ˆðŸ“‘

Gold and Sovereign Securities Price Distribution Analysis: The goal of this task is to provide a comprehensive visual analysis of the price distributions for gold and sovereign securities. By creating detailed and interactive histograms, stakeholders can gain insights into market behaviors, such as typical price ranges, outliers, and volatility, which are crucial for informed investment and trading decisions. ðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰ðŸ”¬

Market Spread Analysis with Regression Modeling: This task aims to deliver a detailed statistical and visual analysis of the relationship between market spreads. By focusing on the regression line and correlation coefficient, we can determine the predictability of one market based on the other. The interactive plot and statistical figures combined provide a robust toolset for market analysts and investors to identify patterns and make data-driven decisions. ðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰ðŸ”¬
