# Gold-Sovereign-Securities-Spread-Dynamics-Analyzer

I have been provided with a dataset named BoG_Bulletin_Gold_2023-11.csv, which encompasses a detailed record of gold and sovereign gold coin prices over time, published by the Bank of Greece. This dataset is pivotal for examining the financial trends, investment opportunities, and market behaviors in the precious metals domain.

The mission is to harness SQL for preliminary data selection and aggregation, and then apply Python for in-depth analysis and data visualization.
